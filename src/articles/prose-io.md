Prose is a web based graphical user interface for writing posts in Markdown; it
is perfect for those who want to start writing a static blog, but want the rich
editing functionality of a WYSIWYG editor. It gives you a clean, minimal
environment for writing and previewing your articles, plus it is integrated with
[GitHub][1] so that you can commit your writing directly to your blog's
repository. In all, a very useful tool, go take a look!
