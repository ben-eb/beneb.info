How do you test CSS? Being a declarative language, when you say you want a
heading to be blue, it is simple as writing `h1 { color: blue }`. But, even if
changes that you make to your stylesheets may seem innocuous, they may lead to
unintended, far-reaching consequences. This site has built up a collection of
resources on best practices for testing CSS; from image diffing, to syntax
linting. Definitely a great starting point for any front end developer.
